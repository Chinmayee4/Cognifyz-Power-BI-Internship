# 📊 Power BI Investment Analysis - Cognifyz Internship
## 🚀 Overview
This project is a part of the Cognifyz Power BI Internship, where I completed a 7-task analysis to explore investment trends. The dataset covers investment preferences, gender-based analysis, investment duration, reasons for investment, and sources of financial information.

Each task was designed to analyze, visualize, and extract key insights using Power BI’s data modeling, Power Query, and DAX capabilities.

# 📝 Task Breakdown & Key Insights
## 📌 Task 1: Data Exploration & Summary
### Objective: Understand and summarize key statistics in the dataset.
#### Key Steps:
✅ Imported and explored dataset structure.

✅ Calculated average age (27.8 years) and percentage of investors in different asset classes.

✅ Analyzed common savings objectives (Retirement, Healthcare, Education).

##### 🔹 Insights:

* Top investment options: Mutual Funds, Equity, Government Bonds.
* Investment distribution: 21.34% in Mutual Funds, 20.54% in Debentures, 16.61% in Government Bonds.
* Savings Objectives: Retirement planning (37 users) is the most common reason for investing.
## 📌 Task 2: Gender-Based Investment Analysis
### Objective: Identify gender-based differences in investment preferences.
#### Key Steps:
✅ Created visual comparisons for investments by gender.

✅ Analyzed investment amounts and preferences across equity, bonds, and mutual funds.

##### 🔹 Insights:

* Male investors dominate in all categories, investing higher amounts:
* Government Bonds: Males (121) vs. Females (65).
* Equity Market: Males (89) vs. Females (50).
* Mutual Funds: Males (61) vs. Females (41).
* Female investors are underrepresented, indicating a potential gap in financial inclusion.
## 📌 Task 3: Investment Objectives Analysis
### Objective: Analyze the relationship between savings goals and investment choices.
#### Key Steps:
✅ Examined correlations between objectives (e.g., Capital Appreciation, Growth) and investment avenues (e.g., Equity, Fixed Deposits, Mutual Funds).

✅ Created charts for most preferred investment choices per objective.

##### 🔹 Insights:

* Capital Appreciation is the primary investment goal (26 users).
* Investors looking for income-focused investments prefer fixed deposits & bonds.
* High-risk investors choose equity markets for long-term capital growth.
## 📌 Task 4: Investment Duration & Monitoring Frequency
### Objective: Examine how long investors hold investments and how often they monitor them.
#### Key Steps:
✅ Visualized investment durations.

✅ Analyzed how frequently users monitor investments (daily, weekly, monthly).

##### 🔹 Insights:

* Most common investment duration: 3-5 years (19 investors), followed by 1-3 years (18 investors).
* Only 2 investors opt for short-term investments (<1 year).
* Most investors monitor their investments monthly (29 users), while only 4 track daily.
## 📌 Task 5: Reasons for Investment
### Objective: Understand why people invest (e.g., better returns, tax benefits).
#### Key Steps:
✅ Created trend analysis charts.

✅ Identified primary investment motivations.

##### 🔹 Insights:

* Better Returns (24 users) is the top reason for investment.
* Fund Diversification (13 users) follows as the second most cited reason.
* Tax Benefits (3 users) are the least considered factor.
## 📌 Task 6: Source of Investment Information
### Objective: Identify where investors get financial knowledge (e.g., Newspapers, Internet).
#### Key Steps:
✅ Analyzed data sources influencing financial decisions.

##### 🔹 Insights:

* Top sources of investment information:
  * Financial Consultants (16 users)
  * Newspapers & Magazines (14 users)
  * Television (6 users), Internet (4 users)
* Traditional sources (consultants & newspapers) dominate over digital sources, suggesting a trust gap in online investment advice.
## 📌 Task 7: Creating a Comprehensive Dashboard
### Objective: Build a Power BI dashboard incorporating all insights.
#### Key Steps:
✅ Designed an interactive dashboard showcasing all analyses.

✅ Used filters and slicers for dynamic data exploration.

##### 🔹 Key Features of the Dashboard:

* Demographic analysis (Age, Gender, Savings Objectives).
* Investment breakdown by type and duration.
* Reasons for investment & information sources.
Final Outcome: A user-friendly, insightful dashboard summarizing all findings in an interactive and visually engaging manner.
